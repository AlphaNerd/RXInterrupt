# RXInterrupt

Interrupt-driven PWM RC receiver handling for Arduino.  Handles up to eight
channels. I have tested it with the FrSky VD5M receiver on Arduino Uno and Due,
Teensy 3.2 and LadybugSTM32L432.

To use, clone this folder to your Arduino/libraries folder.  The <b>examples</b> folder has sketches
for the Arduino Uno and Teensy3.2, which can be easily modified for other boards by changing the pin
numbers.
