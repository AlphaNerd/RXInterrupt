# ArduinoRXInterrupt

2017-12-23 -- I'm going to see if I can adapt this for Arduinos other than the Duo.

Interrupt-driven PWM RC receiver handling for Arduino.  Handles up to eight channels. I have tested it on the Arduino Due with FrSky VD5M and D8R-XP receivers and on the Teensy 3.1 with the VD5M.

To use, clone this folder to your Arduino/libraries folder.
